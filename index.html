<!-- # Build a Small Business Website

## Directions

Your task is to build a three-page website for a small business, Lazy River Nursery and Garden Supply. 
The three pages are:

- A home page (`index.html`)
- "Currently In Stock" - a page of plants they currently have in stock (`in-stock.html`)
- A page showing their hours and location (`info.html`)

N: I couldn't remember how to make a nav menu bar, so got the nav code from ChatGPT. 
        The nav tag creates the nav bar and then there's an unordered list of elements in the 
        navigation menu. 
N: The original code I had did not include the href link. I used the Mozilla notes to add 
        that in

Q: I am unclear on how to link to other pages and whether I create separate "files"?
Q: How can I edit similar lines of code along multiple HTML Docs. -->
